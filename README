A command line program for controlling BlinkM leds connected 
to the I2C bus 3 of a Gumstix Overo expansion board.

There are make files for building the project natively on
the gumstix or as a cross-build on another machine configured
to build software with OpenEmbedded.

The cross-build makefile assumes the cross-tools have been 
setup in gumstix OE standard locations with the exception of 
the top directory.

I use a non-standard OE temp directory "/work/overo-oe/tmp".

You probably want to set this to your ${HOME}/overo-oe/tmp 
unless your tools are also in a non-standard location.


TODO

1. Write script function hasn't been tested much.

2. Need to recover the bus after the command to change an led address.
   Right now you need to power cycle the led which is okay, but you
   also need to power cycle the overo or the i2c bus stays hung.
   
3. GetAddress is not implemented. Investigate if i2c broadcasts are
   possible with the overos.
